# adds swagger-ui-express and swagger.json

-   creates an interactive UI for api documentation.
-   data required for swagger is specified in swagger.json instead of annotations on controllers, to avoid clutter.
-   future plans to add schema and using annotations to auto generate api structure instead of manual maintenance

-   as an alternative to using swagger.json, js-doc has been added.
-   js-doc annotations clutter code base, auto generated doc would be prefered
